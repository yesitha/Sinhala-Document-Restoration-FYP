# **Context-Aware Damage Detection and Text Restoration in Sinhala Handwritten Documents**

This repository contains the implementation of a research-driven project aimed at restoring **damaged Sinhala handwritten documents** using **image processing, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP)** techniques. The project is divided into **four modules**, each addressing different aspects of document damage detection and restoration.

## **Project Overview**  
Handwritten Sinhala documents, often preserved in libraries, offices, and archives, are subject to various damages such as **ink blotches, wear and tear, insect attacks, and missing words**. Unlike English text restoration, Sinhala script poses unique challenges due to its **curved characters and complex structures**. This project applies advanced techniques to **detect, classify, and restore damaged handwritten content**, ensuring readability while preserving original writing styles.

## **Project Modules**  

### ðŸ”¹ **Module 1 - Damage Detection & Classification**  
- Detects **damaged areas** in handwritten Sinhala documents.  
- Classifies damages into **ink blotches, wear and tear, blurred text, insect attacks, and peeled-off areas**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Module 2 - Damage Categorization & Missing Content Estimation**  
- Categorizes detected damages into **minor (affecting parts of letters)** or **contextual (missing full words or phrases)**.  
- Estimates missing content based on **word spacing, character structure, and paragraph context**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Module 3 - Blurred Text Restoration & Letter-Level Damage Reconstruction**  
- Restores **blurred or bleed-through text** to improve readability.  
- Reconstructs **minor letter-level damages** while preserving original handwriting style.  
- Ensures restored text blends seamlessly into the document.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Module 4 - Contextual Missing Text Reconstruction**  
- Restores **larger missing sections**, including **entire letters, words, and phrases**.  
- Ensures the restored text maintains **semantic coherence** with the surrounding content.
